# Description of the experiment:
#
# - We generate the costs to up to 2.000 tasks for 20 to 80 resources
#   with steps of 10.
# - All costs follow linear functions (i.e., constant marginal costs)
#   with RNG seeds [0..79].
# - We schedule 2.000 tasks.
# - We run (MC)^2MKP, MarIn, MarCo, MarDec, MarDecUn, and FedAvg.
# - All resources have a lower limit of 1.
# - The first half of the resources have no upper limit.
# - The second half has an upper limit of 2*(tasks/resources).
# - Each sample is composed of 5 executions of the schedulers.
# - We get 20 samples for each pair (scheduler, tasks)
# - The order of execution of the different schedulers is
#   randomly defined. We set an initial RNG seed = 1000 and increase
#   it every time we need a new order.
